# CMD-Snake-Game
A Command Prompt Snake game inspired by [NVitanovic](https://github.com/NVitanovic) from his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NVitanovic) using the [console header file](https://github.com/DannyAvramov/CMD-Console-Tool) & [Windows.h](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383745(v=vs.85).aspx) header file.
> More info on the [Windows.h file here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows.h).

# Compatibility
Works best with [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) because of it's native [Windows.h](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383745(v=vs.85).aspx) file that powers the command prompt.
